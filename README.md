Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP1
Ans. HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.

Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?
Ans. JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc. JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript. JavaScript is template based not class based.
